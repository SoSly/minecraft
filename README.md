## Server Rules
1. This is Niv's personal world.
    1. Suggestions and bug reports are welcome
    2. Complaints about things you don't like are not welcome
    3. Ask before completing endgame content (such as bosses) without Niv
2. Avoid lagging the server where possible
    1. Don't spam the server with entities
    2. Don't run laggy redstone contraptions
    3. Don't build near 0 ~ 0 without permission.
3. Respect player properties
    1. If you plan to build within 128 chunks of another player, make sure your build does not conflict with their aesthetic, first.
    2. Fix anything you break
    3. Don't take resources without asking
    4. If you spot a disabled mob spawner, don't destroy it
4. Don't destroy the world within 500 chunks of 0, 0
    1. Don't summon the Wither in the Overworld.
    2. Don't destroy or strip villages or other surface structures within that range
    3. Don't leave creeper holes lying around within that range
    4. Don't terraform the surface within that range without discussing it with Niv first.
5. Don't engage in intentional PvP Combat
    1. Contained competitive games (such as spleef) where everyone involved has explicitly agreed to the PvP are fine
6. If something seems easily abused or too good to be true, report it.  Don't abuse it.
7. Do not share the world details for this server outside of the #minecraft channel on SoSly's Discord.
8. Do not travel to other dimensions until Niv has opened them for play. Currently open dimensions:
    - the overworld
